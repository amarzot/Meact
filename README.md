My take on React

Based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnwqU9dqTr4), but with my own code. 

Includes:
* Hooks
* Rendering Components to the DOM
* Update on state change
* Passing properties to components

ToDo:
* Only Update DOM where needed
* Unify builtin vs custom components (array vs function)
